# Deal-In & Living Board — Implementation Plan

> Cross-session working doc. Captures the specs agreed with Quinn (2026-06-11) for two
> juice features: the **Deal-In** (run-start choreography) and the **Living Board**
> (per-cell liveness display + critical-state pressure). Update the Status section as
> work lands. Specs here are *decided*, not proposals — change only with Quinn.

## Status

- [x] Deal-in: spec agreed
- [x] Deal-in: implemented (single-player triggers) — commit pending review, **do not push without approval**
- [ ] Deal-in: multiplayer room-join trigger (deferred — server state arrives async; needs "board empty + moves 0" gate)
- [ ] Deal-in: per-theme polish pass (win98 LCD readout beat, audius/glass/mondrian wordmarks)
- [x] Living Board: liveness computation + two-phase state machine (`computeBoardLiveness`
      in gameLogic.ts; critical enter/exit effect in App.tsx near `gameOverWindingDown`)
- [x] Living Board: default visual treatments + critical audio (55Hz thump + master
      lowpass in audio.ts via `setCriticalAudio`)
- [x] Living Board: paint-based design language (Quinn review round 1: opacity-only
      treatments were invisible — empty cells are near-black pockets on dark panels).
      Language: **warm = alive, ash-grey = dead, ember-red = alarm**, carried by
      stroke + interior fill. `:root` vars in index.css: `--hexaclear-dead-stroke/fill`,
      `--hexaclear-alarm-stroke/fill` — themes override on `:root[data-theme=...]`.
      Alarm keyframes define only the 50% stop so every theme pulses from its own base
      paint toward the shared ember. Known gap: glass hides stroke/dimple, so dead
      cells there only get the 0.8-opacity fallback until its theme pass.
- [x] Living Board: Win98 theme pass (end of theme-win98.css) — shared defaults were
      invisible there (signals lived on the 1px stroke + hidden dimple). Win98 dialect:
      dead = disabled-control grey face; critical = hard 50/50 step blink of the face
      to mine-tile red + LCD digits dropping to the off-segment color, same 900ms clock.
- [ ] Living Board: remaining theme passes (wood ember refinement / glass candle-gutter /
      mondrian red-tick / audius hue-clamp)
- [x] Game-over collapse (supersedes the old "death gutter-out" idea): on a loss, every
      filled hex pops loose in a wave radiating from the killing piece
      (`lastPlacementCellIdsRef`), tumbles with clatter (pitch-dropped clickDown
      samples), and settles into a staged debris pile along the bottom rim (column
      bucketing, stacked in release order). Implementation: cells are DOM-cloned into
      `.hexaclear-collapse-layer` (theme-perfect), originals wear `collapse-hidden`
      (gated on game.gameOver since cell ids repeat across runs), one shared keyframe
      (`hexaclear-cube-collapse`) + per-cube vars does the fake physics. Pile persists
      under the modal (desaturated by the existing wind-down filter); leaving game-over
      sweeps it with a 260ms fade while the deal-in rebuilds. Skipped in multiplayer
      and under reduced motion (desaturate-only, as before).
- [ ] Living Board: multiplayer support — deferred, system fully disabled when `isMultiplayer`
- [x] Announcer, first line: "CUBEKILL" (client/public/cubekill.wav) fires on the deal-in
      title-slam impact via `playCubekillAnnounce`; plays under reduced motion too
- [x] Announcer, placement cues (`playAnnouncerCue`, voiced ~160ms after the clear hit;
      one primary cue per placement; suppressed in tutorial and on game-ending placements;
      single-player only for now): boardclear.wav = board clear (outranks all);
      goodstreak/greatstreak/unbelievablestreak/godlikestreak.wav = streak exactly
      2/3/4/5; double/triple/quad/quintuple/sextuple.wav = 2/3/4/5/6 patterns in one
      placement (lowest priority; 7+ clamps to sextuple). MultiClear.wav retired —
      replaced by the per-count combo lines.
- [x] Announcer text pops (`showAnnouncerPop` + `.hexaclear-announcer-pop`): celebratory
      call text punches in above the board on the voice's beat, sized to magnitude,
      colored by kind (combo gold / streak ember / board-clear blaze), rides the
      screenshake, never mounts under reduced motion. Theme dress: glass gilt Cinzel,
      mondrian flat Archivo Black (red streaks), win98 bevel dialog chip (LCD-red
      streaks); wood/audius use the Monoton default.
- [ ] Announcer, wishlist (recorded lines welcome): "CLOSE CALL!" (critical-exit hook in
      App.tsx, softer/relief tone), "JACKPOT!" (2+ rubies in one placement, layered
      +200ms under the primary per the design doc), per-count combo upgrades to replace
      generic MultiClear (DOUBLE/TRIPLE/OVERKILL/MEGA CLEAR/ULTRA CLEAR for 2/3/4/5/6+),
      streak extensions past 5 (8/10/12 — DOMINATING / UNSTOPPABLE / WICKED SICK), a
      daily-win line (FLAWLESS), optional deadpan game-over line
- [ ] Announcer settings toggle (design doc: separate `Announcer` checkbox, default on)
- [ ] Announcer in multiplayer (placement path exists at the mp.lastPlacement effect)

Implementation deviations from spec (all minor, flag to Quinn if they read wrong):
- Onset freeze reuses the existing 90ms hitstop (spec said 120ms); alarm raises 120ms
  after the freeze starts.
- Dead-cell dimming stays during drag; the ghost preview classes visually dominate
  rather than the map being suppressed wholesale.
- The live-cell breath lives on the dimple (`.hexaclear-slot-fill`), not the hex
  polygon — the polygon's animation slot is contended (octave-2 tint drift, glass
  preview glows) and CSS animations don't compose.
- (Revised per Quinn 2026-06-11, round 2): critical does NOT exit on clears anymore —
  the original exit-and-re-enter on every clear made the alarm flicker and leaked the
  liveness map between pulses. The alarm now holds continuously until ≥8 fits. The map
  is suppressed via `criticalImminent` (derived from the fit count, not criticalActive)
  so it vanishes on the same render as the placement that enters critical territory.

Unrelated pre-existing WIP: `client/src/theme-glass.css` has uncommitted stained-glass
masonry tuning from an earlier session (see root `task_plan.md`/`findings.md`). Keep it
out of feature commits.

## Feature 1: The Deal-In (run-start choreography)

Plays on **fresh runs only**: New Game / reset, daily start (incl. archive days), mode
switch that creates a new game, tutorial exit, and cold load of a pristine (moves=0,
score=0) game. Resumed mid-run games restore instantly with no animation. Never plays
during tutorial stages.

Timeline (≈3.5s perceived, state window 3600ms; slowed 4x from the first cut at
Quinn's request — ceremonial, not snappy):

1. **0–~1.9s — board cascade.** Cells pop in (scale 0 → 1.07 → 1, ~520ms each)
   rosette by rosette: center flower first, then the six outer flowers clockwise by
   screen angle. Rosette stagger 180ms; within a rosette, cells order center-out
   (48ms stagger standard board, 20ms big board). Board chrome (panel, outline,
   grooves) stays static — only the playable surface cascades. Each rosette start
   plays a `click_up` tick pitch-stepped upward across the seven flowers
   (`playDealTick(i, 7)`, playbackRate 1.0→2.0, reduced gain).
2. **1.6–2.85s — hand deal.** Existing `hexaclear-hand-flyin` animation, base delay
   +1600ms during deal-in (slot stagger 175ms unchanged).
3. **0.16–1.66s — CUBEKILL announce.** The wordmark, huge (`clamp(2.8rem, 13vw,
   6.5rem)`), slams over the cascade — blur+scale 2.6 → impact at ~340ms with a small
   screen kick (shake intensity 2.5) — holds, then **flies up and settles into the
   header title's place** (~1.1–1.66s; destination measured in App.tsx, passed as
   `--hexaclear-settle-x/y/scale`). The header title is hidden while the announce
   flies (`is-announce-flying`) so it reads as one object taking its seat; on
   `animationend` the overlay unmounts and the real title shows. Per-theme dress:
   wood = Monoton gold, glass = Cinzel Decorative gilt gradient, mondrian = Archivo
   Black flat black, win98 = giant navy titlebar fragment (its header title is
   `display:none`, so it gets `no-settle` and fades out instead). Impact beat = the
   future "CUBEKILL" voice-line slot. Hidden under reduced motion; unmounts on skip.
4. **2.4–3.5s — chrome beat.** Wordmark brightness shimmer (600ms @ 2400ms);
   score readout pop (480ms @ 3000ms).

Skip: any `pointerdown` during the deal-in ends it immediately (cells snap to final,
hand animations fast-forward 400ms). Reduced motion: cell/chrome animations off, board
does a single 150ms fade, no audio ticks, state window 320ms.

Future hook: when Living Board lands, the cascade's final beat becomes "the light
sweeps on" (liveness lighting activates board-wide as the last rosette lands).

### Code map

- `client/src/App.tsx`
  - `buildBoardRenderData` (~line 1412): now computes `dealDelayByCellId` per mode
    (rosette order via `geometry.flowerCenters` + screen angle from `layout.positions`).
  - Deal-in state + `startDealIn` / `finishDealIn` near `handFlyInToken` (~3312).
  - Triggers: `resetGame`, `exitTutorial`, mode-switch fresh branches (~7546),
    `handleStartDailyForDateKey`, daily-restart button (~14580), mount-pristine effect.
  - Viewport class `is-dealing-in` (~9564); per-cell `--hexaclear-deal-delay` style var
    on the cell `<g>` (~11475).
  - Hand slot fly-in delay base (~17551).
- `client/src/audio.ts`: `playDealTick(step, steps)` — `clickUp` buffer, rate-shifted.
- `client/src/index.css`: `is-dealing-in` rules + keyframes
  (`hexaclear-cell-dealin`, title/stat beats, reduced-motion overrides) near the
  existing hand fly-in block.

## Feature 2: Living Board (liveness + pressure) — NOT YET BUILT

One derived value after every board/hand change: per-cell and total **valid placement
counts** for the current hand (reuse `hasAnyValidMove` machinery in
`game/gameLogic.ts:583`; ≤3 pieces × ≤49 anchors, compute once, memoize).

### Phase A — Liveness (normal play)

- An empty cell is **live** if ≥1 current hand piece has ≥1 valid placement covering it.
- Live cells: normal brightness + shared ambient "breath" (one global 4s sine phase,
  CSS-driven). Dead cells: theme-native dead state, still, 400ms transition.
  Two CSS vars per theme: `--cell-empty` / `--cell-empty-dead`. Default fallback:
  −30% lightness, slight desaturation.
- Dead **hand pieces** (zero fits): desaturate ~40%, 75% opacity, 2° droop sag.
  (An `unplayable` class already exists on hand buttons — extend, don't duplicate.)
- Relight rides the existing clear ripple outward (no new wave system).
- Per-theme dead cells: wood = unlit timber; glass = pane loses backlight; win98 =
  disabled-control grey; mondrian = grey, loses primary eligibility.

### Phase B — Critical state ("under threat")

- **Adaptive thresholds (per Quinn): scarcity is judged per available piece (hand + hold), not raw totals** — enter at ≤2 fits per piece (3 pieces: ≤6; 2: ≤4; 1: ≤2), exit at enter+3 (hysteresis, no strobing; the
  alarm holds continuously across placements, clears, and new hands until escape is real).
- Onset beat: after the triggering placement resolves, 120ms full freeze, then ALL
  empty cells snap to alarm state **simultaneously**; a global 900ms pulse clock starts
  (cells + hand + score readout in sync).
- (Revised per playtest 2026-06-11, round 3): the liveness map STAYS VISIBLE during
  critical — hunting for where pieces can't go isn't interesting difficulty even in the
  endgame. The alarm overlay pulses over the map rather than replacing it. The HAND
  also keeps its differentiation — unplayable pieces stay grey/sagged even
  in critical, and only playable pieces catch the ember glow (Quinn call 2026-06-11,
  reversing the earlier "suspend the sag" spec: piece-level info is desirable at the
  climax; only the cell map is revoked).
- Audio: synthesized 55Hz sine thump per pulse (Web Audio oscillator, ~−18dB under
  master, no asset files) + master lowpass easing toward ~2.4kHz. Both cut instantly
  on exit. Reduced motion: pulses become static state change; thump stays.
- Exit: alarm cuts same-frame on the clear; map relights over 400ms on the ripple.
  This is the "CLOSE CALL!" announcer slot — wire trigger, leave audio empty.
- Per-theme alarm: wood = ember glow pulse in empty cells; win98 = pulsing red inset
  borders + LCD blinking like a VCR at 12:00; glass = irregular candle-gutter flicker;
  mondrian = thickened black borders + grey fill ticking toward red; audius =
  visualizer hue clamps red.

### Guards

- Disabled entirely during tutorial stages (near-complete boards would false-alarm).
- Thresholds absolute on big board.
- PvP territory tints render above dead-cell states at full strength; liveness uses
  the local player's hand on their own screen.
- Game-over at 0 fits fires exactly as today; critical exists only in the 1–5 window.
- Death sequence upgrade (with Living Board): remaining live cells gutter out one by
  one (~60ms stagger) + brief held silence before the existing desaturate wind-down.

### Design rationale (for future sessions)

Per-cell liveness is an approachability assist; the critical state deliberately
**revokes** the map at ≤5 fits so the endgame hunt-for-the-last-fit stays a human
skill. Uniformity of the alarm is load-bearing — any differentiation (cells OR hand)
reintroduces the answer key. Quinn's call, agreed 2026-06-11.

(no FOMO; don't raise cognitive load; juice is the product).
